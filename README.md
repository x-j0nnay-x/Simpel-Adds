## SimpelAdd Mod Info
just a simpel mod that add a vanilla feeling tech aspect to minecraft. useful crafts and doubling or 6X ore production with an ability to automate it all.

This mod does not use FE on any of its automation blocks, this was done to hold true to vanilla and make things feel more advanced without changing the way the game plays.

A key aspect of this mod is the grinder head, this will let you double your raw Iron, Copper, Gold 6X them if you get the Ore Blocks. you can 3X Coal, Diamond, Emerald Ore Blocks. you can craft it into a block form that will use ticks to do the job for you.
There is Speed and efficiency upgrades that can go in this block to get more uses out of the Grind Head, or to even speed up how fast it is. This Grinder Block can then be upgraded to get more slots and have auto splitting form slot 1 down to 4. 

The ice maker gives you 10x ice per water bucket just need to cool it off(snow balls or anything with the Chilling tag).

The Block Factory is like a cobble gen. It will make cobblestone, if you add a grinder head it will make gravel and sand but once its full you can get 4x obsidian per lava bucket.

The Netherite Crafter Block, It will turn one Scrap one gold ingot into a Netherite Ingot, this takes heat so use blaze rods(4 uses per rod). This Block can have the Speed upgrades to make it work faster.

The Upgraded Furnace Block, this is a normal furnace block but with 4 slots. it auto splits from slot 1 to 4. this uses any fuel item and store the burn rate in the block(only use things that can smelt 1 item or more otherwise it will void it). this can smelt things really fast, faster with upgrades in it. This block will also store XP in it once it get high enough it will give you a Bottle o' Enchanting.
